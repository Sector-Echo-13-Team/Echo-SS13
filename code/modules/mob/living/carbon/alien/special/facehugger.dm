 * # Facehugger
 *
 * A simplemob used by aliens to reproduce.  Will attempt to impregnate humans on its own, but can also be picked up and thrown for more efficiency.
 *
 * A small, crab-like creature which latches onto the faces of humans and monkeys and impregnates them with an alien embryo.  After a time, the embryo
 * will explode the "parent" and an alien larva will be born.  Facehuggers can be deterred by using face-covering helmets or impossible to remove masks.
 * They will generally bash against living and synthetic beings they cannot impregnate, eventually killing them.  Aliens can pick them up while alive and
 * throw them, while humans or other handy creatures can only do so while they are dead.
