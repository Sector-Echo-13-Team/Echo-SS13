				<h3>Growing Humans</h3>

				Why would you want to grow humans? Well I'm expecting most readers to be in the slave trade, but a few might actually
				want to revive fallen comrades. Growing pod people is easy, but prone to disaster.
				<p>
				<ol>
				<li>Find a dead person who is in need of cloning. </li>
				<li>Take a blood sample with a syringe. </li>
				<li>Inject a seed pack with the blood sample. </li>
				<li>Plant the seeds. </li>
				<li>Tend to the plants water and nutrition levels until it is time to harvest the cloned human.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
				It really is that easy! Good luck!

			Nuclear Explosives 101:<br>
			Hello and thank you for choosing the Syndicate for your nuclear information needs.<br>
			Today's crash course will deal with the operation of a Fusion Class Nanotrasen made Nuclear Device.<br>
			First and foremost, DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING UNTIL THE BOMB IS IN PLACE.<br>
			Pressing any button on the compacted bomb will cause it to extend and bolt itself into place.<br>
			If this is done to unbolt it one must completely log in which at this time may not be possible.<br>
			To make the nuclear device functional:<br>
			<li>Place the nuclear device in the designated detonation zone.</li>
			<li>Extend and anchor the nuclear device from its interface.</li>
			<li>Insert the nuclear authorisation disk into slot.</li>
			<li>Type numeric authorisation code into the keypad. This should have been provided. Note: If you make a mistake press R to reset the device.
			<li>Press the E button to log onto the device.</li>
			You now have activated the device. To deactivate the buttons at anytime for example when you've already prepped the bomb for detonation	remove the auth disk OR press the R on the keypad.<br>
			Now the bomb CAN ONLY be detonated using the timer. Manual detonation is not an option.<br>
			Note: Nanotrasen is a pain in the neck.<br>
			Toggle off the SAFETY.<br>
			Note: You wouldn't believe how many Syndicate Operatives with doctorates have forgotten this step.<br>
			So use the - - and + + to set a det time between 5 seconds and 10 minutes.<br>
			Then press the timer toggle button to start the countdown.<br>
			Now remove the auth. disk so that the buttons deactivate.<br>
			Note: THE BOMB IS STILL SET AND WILL DETONATE<br>
			Now before you remove the disk if you need to move the bomb you can:<br>
			Toggle off the anchor, move it, and re-anchor.<br><br>
			Good luck. Remember the order:<br>
			<b>Disk, Code, Safety, Timer, Disk, RUN!</b><br>
			Intelligence Analysts believe that normal Nanotrasen procedure is for the Captain to secure the nuclear authorisation disk.<br>
			Good luck!

			<h1>On the Topic of Trickwines</h1>
			The alchemists of Roumain have long held that with sufficient preparation can many a potion be made. Many a daring hunter has returned to their domicile at the aid of an Alchemist. For those who travel, the 'Trickwine' is oft chosen, and so the learners of Roumain pass the secrets on to others. <br>
			A 'trickwine' is a potent brew, made by taking the powers that rest in the world around us and fermenting them in the blessings of Illestren. When imbibed by a Hunter, strength and power flow through their body, yet when shattered upon the beasts of the World, Illestrens' curses are unleashed upon it.<br>
			To freely create a trickwine is the mark of a rising alchemist, and to deliver it in the heat of a brawl is the mark of a true Hunter.<br>
			May this document guide you to both those marks. <br>

			<h2>Brewing Vessels.</h2>
			While many vessels permeate the minds of alchemists, the Breakaway Flask is the instrument of choice for the rising talent. By taking the essence of plasma and infusing it within the body of glass - a most durable vessel is produced for the Trickwine. The glass remains firm lest it impacts upon a foe.<br>
			Any who tinker will find the infusion of essence is done most easily with a flame. Something that burns with a flame most potent. Away from the furnaces of Illestren, the burn of a welder suffices to create the vessel.<br>

			<h2> Trick Ammo </h2>
			Among certain sects of Hunters, the practice of Trick Ammo has arisen. A union between the artful alchemy of Trickwines and the master craftmanship of the Hunters Pride, the Trick Ammo is created through the infusion of Trickwine into .38 casings. <br>
			Dip the casings into the brew, and allow the mixture to to fully permeate its being. A potent weapon, these casings carry a fragment of the offensive power harnessed by the Trickwine.

			<h2> The Bacteria Of Illestren </h2>
			The world of Illestren gave birth to a bacterium that has formed the backbone of alchemical experimentation for countless years. It has given birth to countless fermentation methods, including the cycle of brewing a Trickwine.<br>
			By use of a specialized distillery, the Illestren Bacteria can be maintained in amounts ideal to the fermentation of reagents from Trickwines to Beers. A talented brewer can create their own heritage by blending activating bacterium and reagent into a new concotion. <br>
			Not all vessels of the Militia bear a distillery, but plants transplanted from Illestren carry the bacterium within the flesh of their fruit. Careful nurture of a fruit-bearing plant will allow it to spread the blessings of Illestren. Treat the plant as you would treat any other ally. Allot it drinks. Trim its branches. Protect it from those who seek to harm it.<br>
			Once the fruit has ripened and dropped from the host, an alchemist can take it, fermenting the ripe flesh into a potent mixture of ciders and bacterias entangled together.<br>
			Just as we give to the tree, it shall give to us. It pays a talent to remember this.<br>

			<h2> Common Mixtures </h2>
			Those that find easy success within the alchemical arts have written that to make a Trickwine, one must maintain a careful mixture.<br>
			Three wholes of an ethanol base, with the flavor varied for impact. Entangled with a whole strand of beast, and the blessings of plant. Once cut with the potent catalyst that is the Bacterium, the fermentation is rapid, and a Trickwine is born from the mixture. <br>

			<h2> Wine Of Ash </h2>
			The Wine Of Ash is the most endearing brew to have come from the Distilleries of the Militia. It carries a variety of uses, from the Ceremonies of Roumain, to the warm afterparty of a successful hunt. The flavor is said to be somewhat rustic, with hints of fruit and a sweet yet ashy tang. <br>
			Brewing the Wine Of Ash is a simple task, that even Shadows are expected to do at times. By fermenting a flower of the moon into a potent absinthe, a strong base is formed. Seeping a hallucinogenic mushroom within the absinthe, and then introducing an ash into the mixture of drink and plant creates the Wine Of Ash. One must be patient when brewing, as the brew will be strong, but further fermentation will allow it to blossom into a true vintage.<br>
			Take care whilst brewing to maintain a proper ratio of ingredients. The Wine shall become off-balance if more than one whole of mushroom and one whole of ash is introduced to three wholes of absinthe. One must also take care to protect their eyes, as the Vapors of Ash are a potent irritant.<br>
			The Wine itself is held to be hallucinogenic, although debate rages within the halls of Roumain on the nature of such. A talented brewer can offset such trivialities by cutting the Wine with water, or introducing another substance once it has been fermented. Many a Hunter holds the drink to purify the soul, and strengthen the mind for days ahead.<br>

			<h2> Wine Of Ice </h2>
			The Wine Of Ice is a strong brew formented by the Talent Keo Lanai. Talent Lanai had long found solace from the heat in his visions of the 'Godsforsaken Precipice' that the Ashen Huntsman was said to wander, and sought to share this solace with other Hunters. The flavor is said to be somewhat meaty, with a pleasing current of pepper.
			Brewing of the Wine Of Ice requires a unique assortment of reagents. By fermenting the fur of a bear within traditionally brewed rice sake, Keo Lanai found a solid base for the introduction of Frozen Pepper Essence. It is said that the original brew produced a cold so potent that frost formed on Lanai's brow.<br>
			Hunters favor the Wine Of Ice for blessed relief from heat imbibing it provide. Alchemists have theorized that the brew stimulates the production of sweat in the body, allowing the body to cool itself more rapidly. Other Hunters swear by relief seeping into their burns as the brew finds its way into their system. Others find usage in the potent frost that it leaves upon impact, using it to freeze everything from foe to food.<br>

			<h2> Lightning's Blessing </h2>
			Lightning's Blessing is said to be a potent stimulant, brewed by Hunter Trackers to allow them to track mobile prey through unknown environments. The flavor is said to be sharp and unrelenting, much like the Hunters who indulge in it.<br>
			Lightning's Blessing is brewed with a base of Vodka. By taking vodka and fermenting ground down bones within it, a strong alchemical blend is created. This blend is then inoculated with juiced lemon whilst within a distillery. The resulting blend is an environment ripe for a particular strain of Bacterium to multiply in. This strain of the Bacterium is said to be what gives the flavor to the brew, and its digestion produces a high in most sapients.<br>
			Hunters are said to use Lightning's Blessing as a weapon, where the bacterium, upon being introduced to open air quickly produces an electrical field, shocking whatever the mixture lands upon.

			<h2> Hearthflame </h2>
			Hearthflame is Talent Lanai's other great creation. While travelling through the cold of many a fringe world, Lanai sought the warmth of his home, and took the creation of another mixture as a challenge. By taking the hearty fermented blend of an Illestren Apple, The petals of a Fireblossom, and a hint of phosphorous, Lanai produced a potent heating drink.<br>
			Hearthflame is said to have a bold flavor profile, not unlike an apple shredded apart by tangy pricks. The bacterium is said to stimulate the body and cause it to start heating herself, or in cases of localized exposure, causes rapid, cauterizing heating.<br>
			When this particular blend is exposed to the air, it rapidly heats up. Hunters have advised Shadows be careful if issued it, and most Alchemists refuse to make it unless it is required for the hunt at hand.<br>

				<h1>Frontier Ore Compendium:</h1>
				<h2>A Short Guide On Minerals</h2>
				</center>
				<hr>
				<h2><center>Introduction</center></h2>
					&emsp;The Frontier is a famously material-rich region of space, and with these riches people are drawn in to exploit them. This is usually symied by the fact that a layman cannot identify most ores off visual alone - and in long haul situations, may neglect more valuable ores for ores they are aware of. With this book, you may be able to avoid making such a mistake.<br>

				<center><h2>Ores</h2></center>

					<center><h3><font color="#87423b">Hematite</font></h3></center>
						<ul>
							Hematite is a red-brown crystal typically found within rocks or soil. It is ferric in nature. It is lower yield than most other ores due to impurities.
							<ul>

					<center><h3><font color="#73737b">Magnetite</font></h3></center>
						<ul>
							Magnetite is a naturally magnetic composition of Iron. Due to its natural magnetism, chunks of it have seen usage as good luck charms, or 'lodestones'. Industrial exploitation of magnetite veins is profitable due to high purity.
							<ul>
								<li>1000cm^3 ore yield</li>
								<li>100% iron composition</li>
								</ul>

						</ul>
						<br>
						&emsp;<b>Typically found on:</b>
						<ul>

						</ul>
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>

					<center><h3><font color="#46b89b">Malachite</font></h3></center>
						<ul>
							Malachite is a crystalline copper-carbonate typically found near the surface of worlds with an active water cycle. It is typically low grade, and requires either a smelting or leeching process to actually be of use.
							<ul>
								<li>Not to be confused with magnetite<br></li>
								<li>1000cm^3 ore yield</li>
								<li>100% copper composition</li>

							<li>Ocean Worlds<br></li>
						</ul>
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					<center><h3><font color="#596e67">Galena</font></h3></center>
						<ul>
							Galena is a crystalline composition of lead, silver and sulfer found in most places, with a greater frequency near volcanic areas. Lower technology planets regularly exploit the mineral for usage in primative batteries. Higher technology worlds use the silver for electrical and medical equipment.
							Galena in the frontier is unusually high in silver, which has driven many prospecting missions.
							<ul>
								<li>1000cm^3 ore yield</li>
								<li>95-4-0.2% Lead-Sulfer-Silver Composition</li>
							</ul>
						</ul>

						&emsp;<b>Typically found on:</b>
						<ul>
							<li>Lava Worlds<br></li>
							<li>Waste Disposal Worlds<br></li>
						</ul>
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>
					<center><h3><font color="#593441">Proustite</font></h3></center>
						<ul>
							Also known as ruby silver ore, Proustite is a mineral rich in silver typically found near areas of hydrothermal activity. The odd processes of Jungle-class worlds in the Frontier have made them a hotbed for Proustite mining due to large naturally occuring deposits forming near riverbeds.
							<ul>
							<li>100% Silver Composition</li>
							<li>1000cm^3 Ore Yield</li>

				<center><h3><font color="#d2d46e">Autunite</font></h3></center>
												<center>☢ Warning: Radioactive ☢</center>

						<ul>
							Autunite is a mineral created by the oxidation of pure uranium minerals in most forms of rock. Due to being approximately half uranium by mass, it is radioactive. Waste Disposal worlds have recently garnered interest due to the discovery of extremely large autunite deposits resulting from the rampant dumping of fuel sources.
							<ul>
								<li>100% Uranium Composition<br></li>
								<li>500cm^3 Ore Yield<br></li>

							</ul>

						<ul>
							<li>Waste Disposal Worlds<br></li>
							<li>Shrouded Worlds<br></li>
						</ul>
					<br>

				<center><h3><font color="#ffe88c">Gold Ore</font></h3></center>
						<ul>
							Pure gold ore is an extremely rare phenomenae, with most gold extraction requiring the refinement of dilute ores to acquire the gold. Being a useful electronics component, as well as a symbol of wealth in some societies, the Frontier's pure gold stock is in high demand.
							<li>100% Gold Composition<br></li>

				<center><h3><font color="#ede218">Sulfur Dust</font></h3></center>
				<center> Warning: Flammable</center>
						<ul>
							Sulfur dust is the result of the destruction of sulfer crystals. Short of precise, industrial mining equipment, the destruction of the crystals and creation of this extremely flammable powder is all but guarenteed. Some worlds in the Frontier are attempting to exploit sulfer to create a firearms industry, usually to middling success.
							<li>100% Sulfur Composition<br></li>
							<li>1000cm^3 ore yield</li>

				<center><h3><font color="#ede218">Pyrite</font></h3></center>
				<center> Warning: Flammable</center>
						<ul>
							Pyrite, known by Solarians as "Fool's gold, is a mineral composed of iron, sulfer, and trace amounts of gold. It typically grows into cuboid formations, which to the untrained eye, appear to be gold. The fact that Frontier Pyrite contains actual gold is a curiousity to many geologists, and has been attributed to the geologically rich processes of the worlds it is typically found on.

						</ul>

<br><hr><br>

				<center><h3><font color="#7a95c4">Diamond Ore</font></h3></center>
						<ul>
							Diamond Ore is terminology for any formation containing diamonds. Traditional uses for the crystal include focusing arrays, super-tensile alloy-weaving, and jewelry. The demand is somewhat mitigated by the ability to create lab-grown diamonds being widespread.
							<ul>
								<li>100% Diamond Composition<br></li>
							<li>1000cm^3 Ore Yield</li>

				<center><h3><font color="#ab9a61">Rutile</font></h3></center>
						<ul>
							Rutile is a mineral typically formed by gravity over long periods of time, as well as in igneous rocks. These conditions have lead it to prominence in two types of worlds on the frontier, Lava-classes, where it is uncommon, and typically deep underground, and sand-covered worlds, such as a Salted Sand-Class, or within the dust of a Lunar-class world. It is highly reflective and often sees usage as a semiconductor once refined.

							<li>Lunar Surfaces<br></li>
						</ul>
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>

				<center><h3><font color="#665b5b">Graphite</font></h3></center>
						<ul>
							Graphite is unusually rare in the frontier. What is a somewhat common mineral with widespread uses in the Core Worlds is a rarity often substituted with synthetic alternatives. When it is found, it has usually been migrated away from where it might have become a diamond, and to the surface.
							<ul>
								<li>100% Carbon Composition<br></li>
							<li>1000cm^3 Ore Yield<br></li>
							</ul>

						</ul>
						<br>
						&emsp;<b>Can only be found in trace amounts on most planets</b>

<br><hr><br>

				<center><h3><font color="#665b5b">Coal</font></h3></center>
				<center>Warning: Flammable<br></center>
							<ul>
								Coal is a dark black mineral formed by the compression of decayed carbon over millions of years. While most power-systems have evolved past using it, some industrial plants on low-technology worlds use it by burning it to heat water. Most other worlds utilize it as a source of somewhat pure carbon.

							<li>Desert Surfaces<br></li>
						</ul>
					<br>
					<hr>
					<br>

				<center><h3><font color="#cfb4d1">Quartzite</font></h3></center>
						<ul>
							Quartzite is the result of sandstone experiencing heat and pressure for extended periods of time, with the silicates within the sand becoming somewhat more pure over time. It typically has a dull-gray look, but when refined, is an excellent material for glass, laser equipment, and electronic circuits.
							<ul>

				<center><h3><font color="#dd4cc0">Phoron</font></h3></center>
		<center>Warning: Flammable<br></center>
		<center>Warning: Plasma-Exposure Risk</center>
		<br>
							<ul>
								Phoron is a super-material native to the Frontier, with minor deposits being found all across the Orion Arm. Phoron is extremely corruptive of carbon-based matter, and oxidizes at a rate that surpasses most everything but fusion reactors. As such, plasma, be it gas from a Plasma Giant, or the crystalline compounds that permeate the surfaces of the frontier, is in high demand.
								<ul>
									<li>82-10-5-2.5 Plasma-Quartz-Carbon-Sulfer Composition<br></li>
