  Skies-Of-Blue:
  - rscadd: creates close_hatch, a step that mirrors open_hatch in prosthetic surgeries

      before screwing to finish surgery. This affects implant removal, ipc revival,
      mechanical brain surgery, and prosthesis organ manipulation
  - rscadd: creates manipulate_organs/mechanic, a step that swaps the necessary implements
      in synthetic surgery. Use a crowbar instead of a hemostat to remove any organs
      on an augmented limb!

      is as follows: screwdriver, hand, wrench, crowbar, wrench, hand, screwdriver'

      Amputation. This allows for prosthesis users to remove their own limbs, for
      the purposes of maintenance or just plain comfort! The tool order is as follows:
      screwdriver, hand, multitool, wrench, crowbar/wrench/hand (so you can flavor
      how you remove the limb)'
  - tweak: 'changes the Prosthetic Replacement surgery, renaming it to Limb Grafting
      surgery. The steps remain the same, but the name needed some retooling, as the
      procedure is much more surgically involved than its new sibling:'
  - rscadd: 'creates Prosthesis Attachment surgery, a less surgically involved version
      of the Limb Grafting surgery. This allows for people with prostheses to re-attach
      the limb they took off with Prosthesis Removal! The tool order is as follows:
      wrench, multitool, plug in prosthesis, hand, screwdriver'
