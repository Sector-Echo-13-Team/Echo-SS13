      M-90gl toploaders.

      or take advantage of inherits, when possible.

      apply to inedible or rotting foods. (baseball burgers)
  - balance: All butchered player species are considered to be gore, only preferred
      by Lizards, Arachnids, Kepori, Slimepeople and Flies. If you like the taste
      of your fellow(or rival) crew, prepare accordingly.
