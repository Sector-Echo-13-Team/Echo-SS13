	"description": "The Talos is a command and support ship, and a rare example of a purpose-built Inteq ship. Outfitted with an abundance of construction and engineering equipment and a private bluespace communications suite capable of networking IRMG ships across any given system, Taloses are often the lynchpin of coordinated IRMG operations in a system, and offer construction and repair services as part of IRMG’s mercenary offerings. As Talos crews place a larger emphasis on support personnel, they tend to be less well-armed than other Inteq crews. One unusual feature of the Talos is its “wings” filled with redundant baffles, intended to provide extra durability in the case of impacts or weapons fire. They also offer auxiliary storage space and potential room for modification by their enterprising Artificer crews.",
