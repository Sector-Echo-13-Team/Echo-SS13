The Radio Broadcasting Ship is an anomalous thing in its own right. It is  a “ship” equipped with nothing but radios and reality warping engines. There exist many reports of this vessel being totally destroyed and showing back up in a sector just hours later. The only thing you can do about these vessels is pray the pilot doesn’t have bad taste.",
