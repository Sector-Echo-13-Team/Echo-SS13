	"description": "Manufactured by ISF Shipyards, the F-80 is a small, nimble yacht popular as a leisure craft throughout the core worlds. While rare on the Frontier, F-80s are occasionally seen touring the CLIP worlds or taking part in hunting trips by wealthy coreworlders pursuing the Frontier's infamous megafauna. Frequently, a Saint-Roumain Militia hunter will be hired as a hunting guide for such trips, with appropriate quarters provided- few others are as well versed in the many dangers of the Frontier's wildlands.",
