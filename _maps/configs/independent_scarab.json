	"description": "The Scarab-class is a recently-introduced heavy drilling ship built by Hardline Salvage and Mining. Inspired by Hardline's earlier work on the Talos-class refits, the Scarab comes with heavy drilling equipment and facilities for a number of technicians and hired guards instead of the hand-mining equipment typically found on smaller ships. Extra space for storage or potential remodeling lends the Scarab a degree of flexibility few of its peers can afford.",
