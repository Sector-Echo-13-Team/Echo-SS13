	"description": "The Hyena is a common salvage tug, frequently operated by the Gorlex Marauders for “salvage” missions on ICW-era Nanotrasen derelicts (and occasionally occupied outposts and ships). The Hyena features a fairly compact floor plan with a dedicated secure armory space and a fairly large cargo bay for its size, as well as a complement of high-grade hardsuits and mining equipment. The Hyena’s low cost and high demand in its niche has made it a very common sight on the Frontier in the years following the ICW, and despite their tight finances nearly all Gorlex Marauder splinter factions continue to acquire more.",
