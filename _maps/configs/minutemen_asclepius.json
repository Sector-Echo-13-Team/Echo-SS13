Well stocked in medical supplies, this vessel is known for its capability of fulfilling extensive treatment for patients in sectors where such treatment is otherwise scarce. Stocked with a cryo lab, a morgue, a chemlab, and surgery room, the Asclepius rarely finds difficulty when provided all measures both preventative and restorative.",
