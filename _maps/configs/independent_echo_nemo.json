Featuring a comfortable study, a full robotics workshop (perfectly suited to building yourself some assistants!) and a host of esoteric weapons suitable for hunting creatures to mount above your fireplace. Other highlights include a compact-yet-functional medical bay, a reasonably well-designed engineering bay and a large array of mining equipment.",
