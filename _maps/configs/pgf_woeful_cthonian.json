	"description": "A new design of patrol ship designed by Etherbor's Lihmona Navy Shipyards and manufactured by Axilai Orbital Works, the Woeful Cthonian is a small ship with average maneuverability and firepower designed for sustained operations in contested space. While it is not able to hold its own in a firefight with proper warships, lacks specialization into any particular field, and carries no proper marine complement. Despite what some would consider shortcomings, it still finds solid usage as a generalist vessel for the Gezenan navy.",
