	"description": "The Cirrus-class is a Cybersun design originally drafted in 467 FSC, and was put to production by ISF Spacecraft the following year. The original design served faithfully as a transport for Cybersun Executives, but the current revision has been billed as 'Trauma Team Response Vehicle'. A docking port for a Gauze-class subshuttle allows rapid response to medical emergencies, and priority treatment for those in Cybersun's graces.",
