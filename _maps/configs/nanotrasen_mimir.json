	"description": "The Mimir-class are Nanotrasen “patient” transfer and holding ships. Nanotrasen deploys Mimirs to hold those they’ve interned, often in ruined or otherwise out-of-the-way sectors. This both minimizes the chances of the “patients” escaping and drastically lowers the incentive to do so in the first place, as it keeps them stuck in the middle of nowhere until Central Command is ready to pick them up and process them. While “patients” are largely kept in cryogenic storage, regulations and medical necessity both require occasional thawing. As such, the Mimir comes with a host of “rehabilitative” activities for the “patients” as well as a light security detail to manage them.",
