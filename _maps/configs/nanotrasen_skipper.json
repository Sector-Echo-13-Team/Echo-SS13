	"description": "An example of one of Nanotrasen’s “standard-pattern” cruisers. The Skipper-class is well-equipped by Frontier standards, with ample room for engineering equipment, well-appointed crew accommodations, and a decent supply of defensive weaponry. Notably, the Skipper comes with a larger command section than average, and the officers on Skippers tend to be better-equipped than their peers. Though not as prestigious as a position aboard an Osprey, few Nanotrasen captains would turn down a position commanding a Skipper.",
