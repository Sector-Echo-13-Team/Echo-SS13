Each ship is designed around a central garden consisting of plants, soil, and a tree from the owning Montagnes’ home planet. As a highly religious ascetic order, the SRM supplies each Elder with supplies to farm, raise animals, and perform medicine in more “natural” ways, using herbs and plants grown in house. The ship is captained by a Montagne, who oversees a team of Hunters, and Shadows apprenticing them.",
