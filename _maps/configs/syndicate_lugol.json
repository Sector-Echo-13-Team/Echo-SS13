	"description": "The Lugol is effectively an enormous Galactic Engineers Concordat research barge, used as a test bed for refinements to power systems, new technologies, and so on. As it offers freedom from the usual constraints of working aboard vessels belonging to other Syndicate factions, Lugols are especially popular among the GECâ€™s more radical members. Accordingly, they have a reputation for either accomplishing the impossible or generating the equivalent of a new star when they inevitably melt down. Lugols are generally only found on the Frontier, where the collateral damage from potential accidents can be kept to a minimum and secrecy, when needed, can be better maintained.",
