	"description": "The “Pillbottle,” as a class, should not rightfully exist. Tell-tale signs indicate that these ships originated as bulk carriers and tugs, but they have since been haphazardly converted into a carrier of sorts for a wing of Pill-class escape pods. As with the Pills, Pillbottles are crewed entirely by escaped prisoners, and as a rule, they operate in a state of complete anarchy. The only consistent aspect of Pillbottle crews is their inconsistency, but the realities of prison life tend to make the worst out of anyone.",
