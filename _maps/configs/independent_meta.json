	"description": "The Meta-class is a small freight vessel, and even before the ICW was a common sight on the Frontier as a tramp freighter, running independent contracts between the myriad outposts of the area (with, occasionally, some smuggling or mining on the side). Since the collapse of Nanotrasenâ€™s logistics network in the Frontier region, Meta-classes operating in this capacity have exploded in popularity, and are likely to remain a very common sight wherever larger corporations such as Donk! Co. have yet to establish market dominance.",
