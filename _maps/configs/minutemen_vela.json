	"description": "The Vela-class is Lunatown Orbital Work's most prolific hull, with the first to its name having been laid down in 443. The Vela is renowned for its easily reconfigurable profile - owning to external connectors which allow anything from bulk cargo pods to mech hangars to be bolted onto the hull. Most hulls ordered by CLIP are configured to carry a refinery, mechanized mining gear, light Minuteman compliment, and a hefty suite of amenities for the crew, leading to the designation as an Industrial Cruiser.",
