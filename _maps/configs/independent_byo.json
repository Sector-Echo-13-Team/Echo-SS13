The only thing that separates crews on a BYO from breathable safety and the cold vacuum of space are typically little airtight flaps of plastic. Equipped with a plethora of building material and tools fit for construction, BYO vessels are seen in a variety of shapes and sizes, and almost never with any consistency of form.",
